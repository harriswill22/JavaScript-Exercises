    <h3>Do's and Donts of Javascript</h3>
    <h4>Do's</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Declare Variables</li>
        <li>Use === instead of == </li>
        <li>Use Semicolons</li>
        <li>Use delete properly</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dont's</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid Global Variables</li>
        <li>Don't Use eval()</li>
        <li>Don't Use with()</li>
        <li>Avoid setting variables to undefined </li>
        <li>Avoid Using new with Javascript Objects </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Closure Defined</h3>
    <p>A closure is the local variables for a function - kept alive after the function has returned</p>
    <p>Closure is when a function is able to remember to access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope</p>
    <p>** A closure is function having access to parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. (callbacks)(setTimeout) </p>
    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures </h3>
    <h4>Big O Notation</h4>
    <p>It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow</p>
    <p>O(n+10) = 0(n)  O(1000n+50) = O(n)  O(n^2 +5n +8) = O(n^2)</p>
    <h5>n matters the most</h5>
    <li>BigO for adding key into an object O(1) </li>
    <li>BigO for accessing key in an object O(1) </li>
    <li>BigO for removing key from an object O(1) </li>
    <h5>Algorithm</h5>
    <p>A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task</p>
